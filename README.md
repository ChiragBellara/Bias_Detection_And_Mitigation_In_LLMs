# Bias Detection and Mitigation in Large Language Models.

## Overview:
This project aims to systematically identify, quantify, and mitigate the biases present in Large Language Models. By exploring various aspects of bias in LLMs, we seek to enhance the fairness and inclusivity of these models, ultimately improving their reliability and trustworthiness. The key objectives of this project are as follows:
<ol>
  <li><b>Bias Identification:</b> Analyze model outputs to detect and categorize types of biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases.</li>
  <li><b>Bias Quantification:</b> Compare the performance of different LLMs to understand the variations in learned biases.</li>
  <li><b>Bias Mitigation Strategies:</b>  Evaluate various strategies to minimize and mitigate biases, including data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and post-processing techniques.</li>
</ol>
